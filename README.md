# Delay_Payments
Loan Payment Delay Analysis Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on loan issuance and overdue trends using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Insights into late payments, severity of delays, and factors affecting repayment behavior.

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of loan issuance and overdue payment trends using Python. The objective is to identify key patterns in late payments, assess the severity of delays, and examine factors influencing repayment behavior.

🔍 Objectives

Analyze the late payment rate and its trend over time.
Evaluate the severity of payment delays, specifically loans overdue by more than 30 days.
Investigate factors contributing to payment delays, including:
The relationship between loan amount and overdue days.
Seasonal patterns in late payments (monthly/quarterly trends).
Differences in repayment behavior between repeat and first-time borrowers.
📈 Key Insights

The correlation between loan amount and overdue days is -0.007, indicating no significant relationship.
Late payments may exhibit seasonal variations, suggesting the need for further cohort analysis.
Differences in late payment rates between repeat borrowers and new clients may provide insights into credit risk assessment.
